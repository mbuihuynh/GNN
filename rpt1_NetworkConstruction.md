Summary: before applying the machine learning on complex graph, this network needs constructed from unstructured data such as from vector based data or time series data.

1. Introductions:

Vector based data is a set of items which can have an inter related data without intra vectors. If we try to combine these relationships into vector, it can loss information or becomes complex. Network is components obtaining the relation data such as social network (Facebook, Twitter), customer - purchase - items set, drugs design,etc (refer to Unstructure vs. Structure data diagram at Fig1)
